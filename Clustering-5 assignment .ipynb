    "A pair confusion matrix extends the regular confusion matrix by incorporating costs or penalties for different types of classification errors. It considers the relative importance of errors in a specific application. This matrix helps in evaluating models by explicitly accounting for costs associated with false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. It is useful when costs of errors vary, enabling a more nuanced analysis and decision-making process. The pair confusion matrix aids in cost-sensitive learning and decision-making scenarios, ensuring models align with specific priorities and constraints."
